# Euclidean-Algorithm

I am a begineer in Java. 
my achievements in this code are:
* learn how to pass user's input by bufferedReaderStream
  BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
 String intput_b =  br.readLine();

*how to convert string to integer
 int b = Integer.parseInt(input_b);

* how to pass arguments to other classes

The idea of Euclidean algorithm is from this here:
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm

This algorithm can generate maximun common divisor of two integers.

**Example and output is like this:**

enter two numbers to get Greatest Common Divisor(GCD)
Enter the first number
270
Enter the second number : > We loved with a love that was more than love
192

GCD(270, 192)
=GCD(192 , 78) 
=GCD(78 , 36) 
=GCD(36 , 6) 
=GCD(6 , 0)
