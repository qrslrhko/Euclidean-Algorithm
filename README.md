# Euclidean-Algorithm


The idea of Euclidean algorithm is from [here] (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm)

I am a begineer in Java, my achievements in this code are:

##### learn how to pass user's input by bufferedReaderStream
```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
String input_a = br.readLine();
```
##### how to convert string to integer
```java
int a = Integer.parseInt(input_a);
```
